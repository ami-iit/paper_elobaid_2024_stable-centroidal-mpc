## Paper

The paper is under review. The preprint is available in the following link https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01144

## Code organization

The MPC problem formulation for both the humanoid case and the quadruped case are housed in submodules. The code is organized as follows
-  examples houses example code and scripts allowing to install and run the MPC and produce plots/simulations for a bipedal and a quadruped.
- `humanoid-mpc` points to the implementation of the Centroidal MPC (Casadi + IPOPT) with the possibility of setting a flag enabling or disabling the stability constraints
- `quadruped-mpc` points to the implementation of the Centroidal MPC through ACADOS with the possibility of using different quadruped robots and terrains.

## Examples and usage
To use the examples in the example directory you can simply run the corresponding `run_and_plot.sh` script as in the following 
### humanoid example
The humanoid example simulates using the Centroidal MPC with the flag `enable_stability_cstr` off and then on. It then generates gifs/animation of the data of the footsteps and CoM trajectory in both cases.
The simulation, to test for edge cases, runs the MPC with `dt = 200ms` with a horizon length of `5 steps`. In this way we emphasize the role played by the stability constraints in ensuring success as opposed to the nominal case. To run the example you simply do

```bash
cd examples/humanoid
chmod +x run_and_plot.sh
./run_and_plot.sh
```
The above script builds the MPC suite housed in the submodule `humanoid-mpc` . Make a build directory for the example in `main.cpp` , build and install it, and then run the matlab plotting scripts for the generated data.
If successful, you should be able to see animations of this kind in your build/bin directory

<p> ‚ö†Ô∏è The `run_and_plot.sh` script assumes you have the dependencies of the `bipedallocomotionframework` housed in the submodule `humanoid-mpc`. Please check https://github.com/ami-iit/bipedal-locomotion-framework/?tab=readme-ov-file#page_facing_up-mandatory-dependencies for the details </p>


<p> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not build `bipedallocomotioninterface` from master. The script will handle building and installing the correct version with the relevant commit. Only ensure you have the dependencies installed in your system </p>


### Quadruped example
The quadruped example simulates using the MPC with and without the stability constraints with a quadruped (Aliengo). It produces the simulations using mojoco. To run the example you simply do

```bash
cd examples/humanoid
chmod +x run_and_plot.sh
./run_and_plot.sh
```

You should be able to see something similar to (with obvious difference in performance between nominal and stable centroidal MPC)
